### Hello, welcome to my page! :rocket:

I'm a software engineer with extensive experience in A/B testing, and heuristics for solving _certain_ np-hard problems.

My favourite experiences are in Rust and Scala with an addiction to typing things (sometimes poorly).

#### 🔭 I’m currently working on ...
- `testsmith.nvim` some test helpers for nvim.
- `sink` a experimental text collaboration engine using ssh, domain sockets, and other fun.
- `reovim` learning project to understand layout engines, tree based rendering, tui's, text editing. (A fun aside is I'm planning a library plugin based experience, so ever user can build and add plugins in a cargo project)
- `caustics` experimenting with `stillwater` to see how a webserver could utilize it's API for composible routing.
- `bevy_ocean` ⚠️ on hold. Using FFT to simulative an ocean in bevy.
- `tinyswords` ⚠️ on hold. Creating a full game in bevy for fun and probably no profit.

#### 🤔 Next projects ...
- `spot` framework for shadow validating live services, forks request's and collects spot's the difference.

#### 🌱 I’m currently learning ...
- `agentic development` with claude, it's honestly too good
- `rust` delving deep into rust
- `bevy` the ecs game engine is great
